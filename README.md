Using alphapose for pose estimation

Pretty much everything is given in the notebook, all you gotta do is upload your images for which you want pose estimation and magic!

Results are pretty amazing:

We can also download the json file and use it further for detection of a particular pose using any classifier, code for that coming soon!!

Thanks!
